Description:
  C: "Writer is the word processor inside LibreOffice productivity suite.\nUse it for everything, from dashing off a quick letter to producing an entire\nbook with tables of contents, embedded illustrations, bibliographies and diagrams.\nThe while-you-type auto-completion, auto-formatting and automatic spell-checking\nmake difficult tasks easy (but are easy to disable if you prefer).\nWriter is powerful enough to tackle desktop publishing tasks such as creating\nmulti-column newsletters and brochures. The only limit is your imagination."
